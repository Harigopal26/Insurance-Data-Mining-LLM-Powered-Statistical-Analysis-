      "\n",
      "The most predictive combination of variables for insurance charges would be smoking status and age. From the bivariate analysis, we can see that there is a strong positive linear relationship between age and charges, with older individuals paying higher insurance costs. Additionally, smokers experience a bigger increase in insurance charges as they age compared to non-smokers. This is further supported by the multivariate analysis, where we can see a strong positive relationship between age and charges in the 3D scatter plot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, the scatterplot colored by different categorical variables suggests that smokers from all regions are paying higher insurance charges, with a greater number of smokers from 'other' regions paying higher charges. This indicates that smoking status is a key factor in determining insurance charges, and it is even more influential than the region where a person lives.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of other variables, BMI does not seem to have a significant impact on insurance charges. While there is a weak positive relationship between BMI and age, it is not strong enough to be considered a predictive combination. Similarly, the region where a person lives does not seem to have a big impact on insurance charges, as there is no clear pattern or direction in the scatter plot.\n",

      "1. Age and Charges: There is a strong positive relationship between age and charges, indicating that as people get older, they tend to pay more for insurance. This is because older individuals often require more medical care, leading to higher insurance costs. However, the relationship is not perfectly linear, as there are some outliers in the data. This suggests that while age is a significant factor in determining insurance charges, there are other factors at play as well.\n",

      "2. BMI and Charges: There is a weak or negligible relationship between BMI and charges. This means that BMI does not have a significant impact on insurance charges. However, there are some outliers in the data, indicating that there may be some individuals with high BMI who are paying higher charges. Overall, BMI does not seem to be a major factor in determining insurance charges.\n",

      "3. BMI and Age: There is no clear pattern or direction in the relationship between BMI and age. This suggests a weak correlation between the two variables.
